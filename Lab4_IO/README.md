#Lab4_IO  

## Purpose
The purpose of this second lab is to introduce a simple debugging process. <br/> 
Debug a simple program involving input from switches and output to LEDs.  <br/>

## What It Does
The system will have two inputs and three outputs. The inputs are switches called SW1 and SW2, <br/> 
which are connected port pin PF4 and PF0 respectively. Three outputs (PF3, PF2, PF1) are connected <br/> 
to one multi-color LED. The circuit diagram used in Lab 4 is enclosed in this folder. The color of the <br/> 
LED is determined by the 3-bit value written to the outputs. The specifications are summarized in <br/> 
the image located in this folder.
